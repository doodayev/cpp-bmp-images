### Build Instructions
In order to build either the CLI or GUI version. Simply open
the project file with C++ Builder and build the project.

In theory, any version of C++ Builder that supports C++ 17 (or higher) should work
and this shall remain true for years to come.

#### Some notes about the program:
-Both versions of the program must be in the same directory
as the pictures you wish to sort.

-For the CLI version of the program the order of arguments are:
Red, Green, Blue, Width, Height, Choice
First five values are integers. Sixth value is a character.

-Height starts from bottom and goes to top.

-Width starts from left goes to right.

-Whatever zip files are included are image sets for you to try
out the program with.
